# AI-Native ERP with AI Accountant Agent

An AI-native ERP for small businesses: a full double-entry accounting core
(sales, purchases, expenses, banking, fixed assets, financial statements)
driven by a natural-language AI agent that reasons about business events,
resolves dependencies, asks consolidated clarifying questions, requires
explicit confirmation for sensitive mutations, and independently verifies
every execution against the database.

## Architecture

```
Next.js 15 frontend (port 3000)
        │  Bearer JWT (Supabase session)
        ▼
FastAPI backend (port 8000)  —  app/main.py
        │
        ├── Agent pipeline (app/agent.py, planner.py, reasoning.py)
        │     intent → economic-event classification → 360° impact analysis
        │     → targeted context → dependency resolution → consolidated
        │     clarification → confirmation gate → trusted tools → validation
        │     → accounting engine → independent verification
        │
        ├── AI Orchestrator (app/ai_orchestrator.py)
        │     Token Harbor gateway (DeepSeek V4.1 text/tools, Mimo vision,
        │     OpenAI-compatible, free-tier models)
        │     → Qwen chain (Alibaba Model Studio, capability-aware)
        │     → Gemini (final fallback, key from Supabase Vault)
        │     provider fallback ONLY for provider-level failures; never
        │     replays a request after any tool has executed
        │
        ├── Tool Router (app/tool_router.py) — registry, permissions,
        │     validation, duplicate protection; no arbitrary SQL from the LLM
        │
        └── Supabase PostgreSQL (service_role, RLS enforced for clients)
              public.* business schema + ai.* agent control plane
```

## Stack

- **Backend:** Python 3.12, FastAPI, pydantic-settings, supabase-py, structlog
- **Frontend:** Next.js 15 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4, Supabase SSR
- **Database:** Supabase-hosted PostgreSQL (RLS on all tables)
- **AI:** Token Harbor gateway (DeepSeek V4.1 / Mimo, primary) · Alibaba
  Cloud Model Studio / Qwen (secondary) · Google Gemini (final fallback)

## Capabilities

- Customers, suppliers, products, services, projects
- **Products & Services catalogue**: a dedicated management page with live
  status, search and status filters, inline create/edit/deactivate/delete.
  Items that documents already reference are archived instead of deleted, so
  history keeps resolving them.
- **Party sub-ledgers**: every customer gets its own receivable account and
  every supplier its own payable account, as a child of the control account,
  so receivables/payables stay segregated per party for reporting.
- Quotations (with conversion to invoices), sales invoices
- Credit notes (customer returns): branded printable documents, mandatory
  reason, status flow DRAFT → ISSUED → VOIDED, and a deterministic reversal
  journal (Dr revenue / Cr receivable) auto-validated, auto-posted and
  source-tied on creation
- Purchase bills, debit notes / purchase returns (same journal discipline
  on the payable side), expenses
- Receipts and payments with full/partial allocation and settlement
- Banking: accounts, transfers, transactions
- Fixed assets: registration, depreciation schedules, disposal
- Double-entry journal engine with source-tied entries, reversals
- Trial balance, general ledger, profit & loss, balance sheet, cash flow,
  aging, project profitability reports
- AI agent: reasoning/planning, clarification and confirmation workflows,
  document/vision extraction feeding normal ERP reasoning
- IFRS-oriented account proposals: a new revenue or expense nature is routed to
  a dedicated account under the right parent, and the classification is
  confirmed by the user before any account is created
- Prerequisite resolution: when a document needs a customer, supplier or
  catalogue item that does not exist yet, the agent resolves it against the
  live books, asks when the reference is ambiguous, and proposes the missing
  record for confirmation before the document is posted
- Organization onboarding, roles/permissions, audit logging

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- Node.js 20+
- A Supabase project (database URL + keys)
- An AI provider key — optional for UI-only use; supported providers are a
  Token Harbor universal key (primary), an Alibaba Model Studio key (Qwen)
  and Google Gemini. The app starts and serves the dashboard even with no
  AI provider configured (provider initialisation is lazy and never blocks
  startup)

### Setup

1. **Database:** apply the SQL migrations in `database/migrations/` in
   filename order (`001…083`) to a fresh Supabase project.
2. **Backend config:** copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your values.
   Never commit `.env`. The Gemini key lives in Supabase Vault and is read
   via the `get_gemini_api_key()` RPC (service_role only).
3. **Python deps:**
   ```bat
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Frontend deps:**
   ```bat
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

### Run

One click (starts backend + frontend, waits for health, opens the browser):

```bat
Runapp.bat
```

Or manually:

```bat
venv\Scripts\python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

- App: http://localhost:3000
- API: http://localhost:8000 (docs at `/docs`, health at `/api/health`)

### Health

```bat
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health
```

## Environment variables

See `.env.example` for the full annotated list. Key variables:

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | Database access (service role: backend only, never the browser) |
| `QWEN_API_KEY`, `QWEN_BASE_URL`, `QWEN_MODEL_CHAIN`, `QWEN_VISION_MODEL_CHAIN`, `QWEN_BANNED_MODELS` | Secondary AI provider and capability-aware chains |
| `TH_API_KEY`, `TH_BASE_URL`, `TH_TEXT_MODEL`, `TH_VISION_MODEL_CHAIN`, `TH_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | Primary AI gateway (Token Harbor) — the key may be resolved from Supabase Vault instead of the environment |
| `GEMINI_MODEL` | Fallback provider model (key stays in Supabase Vault) |
| `AI_PRIMARY_PROVIDER`, `AI_FALLBACK_PROVIDER` | Provider routing |
| `APP_HOST`, `APP_PORT`, `APP_ENV`, `CORS_ORIGINS` | Server configuration |

Frontend (`.env.local`): `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`,
`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` — browser-safe values only.

## Deployment

The repository ships a `vercel.json` with two services: the Next.js app
(`frontend/`) and the FastAPI backend (`app.main:app`). Pushing to `main`
deploys production; every other branch gets a preview deployment.

| Check | Command |
|---|---|
| Production URL | `https://ai-accountant-erp.vercel.app` |
| Backend health | `GET /api/health` → `{"status":"ok",...}` |
| API docs | `/docs` (OpenAPI) |

Set the environment variables from `.env.example` in the Vercel project
(Production + Preview) before the first deploy; leave the service-role key and
provider keys as project secrets.

## Project structure

```
app/                 FastAPI application
  main.py            HTTP surface (auth, catalogue, AI, reports, …)

  accounting_reasoning.py, semantic_layer.py, planner.py
  tool_router.py, tools/           registered, permission-checked ERP tools
  accounting_engine.py             deterministic journal construction
  services/, repositories/         business logic and data access
  prompts.py, config.py            model instructions and settings
database/migrations/ SQL schema, applied in filename order
frontend/            Next.js 15 App Router UI
docs/                governance document and design references
scripts/             background worker and operator utilities
```

## Security notes

- All secrets are environment/Vault based; no credentials are hardcoded.
  `.gitignore` protects `.env`, `.env.*`, logs, caches and build output.
- RLS is enabled on every table; clients only ever use the anon key.
- The LLM can only invoke the registered, permission-checked ERP tools;
  it never executes arbitrary SQL or code.
- Financial mutations pass a validator + accounting engine and an
  independent database verification step before success is reported.
- Resolution logic (matching a name to a record) is read-only and
  tenant-scoped: it never invents ids and never writes during resolution.

## Known limitations

The following are not implemented and are refused cleanly rather than
simulated: multi-warehouse stock ledger / inventory movements, payroll and
employee management, cost centers / departments / locations, and complete
tax-to-GL mapping for all jurisdictions.

"""
AI-native semantic understanding layer.

This is the PRIMARY interpretation stage of the ERP. The user's request — in
whatever natural wording — is understood here as structured business meaning,
grounded against the user's own words, and normalized into the ERP's
deterministic vocabulary. The keyword regex extractor in the planner is the
FALLBACK, never the competing intelligence.

Architecture: docs/SEMANTIC_ARCHITECTURE.md.

Pipeline role:
    USER REQUEST -> LLM SEMANTIC UNDERSTANDING -> GROUNDED FACTS
    -> DETERMINISTIC NORMALIZATION -> planner -> validation -> execution.

Grounding contract (python-enforced, never negotiable):
* party/item text must occur VERBATIM in the user's own words;
* numbers must be traceable to a digit token or written number;
* dates must be explicit in the text or a resolvable relative word;
* enums are validated against canonical vocabularies;
* party_role must be consistent with the activity's money direction;
* a value that cannot be traced is DROPPED with its status preserved as
  AMBIGUOUS/MISSING — never repaired, never closest-matched, never executed.

  payment_terms, transaction_date, transaction_nature, account_name,

STATE VOCABULARY: EXPLICIT | SAFELY_INFERRED | AMBIGUOUS | MISSING
  - facts[] carries only EXPLICIT and SAFELY_INFERRED entries.
  - ambiguous[] carries AMBIGUOUS entries (each with its candidates).
  - missing[] carries MISSING entries (each with why it is required).
  - A fact that is EXPLICIT or SAFELY_INFERRED must NOT also appear in
    ambiguous[] or missing[].

OTHER RULES:
  - payment_terms is always one of CASH, CREDIT, BANK_TRANSFER, CHEQUE, CARD
    (inferred meanings count: "will pay later"/"udhaar" -> CREDIT).
  - party_role is customer or supplier, and must agree with the money
    direction of the activity.
  - quantity and amount are NUMBERS, never strings.
  - Give at most 3 entries in ambiguous[] and at most 3 in missing[] -
    only the ones that genuinely block a correct recording.
  - If more than one distinct business act is requested, list every activity
    in activities[] (in the order described) and set "clause_count" to the
    number of distinct acts.
  - If the request needs something this ERP has no capability for, list it in
    unsupported[] and do not invent a field for it.

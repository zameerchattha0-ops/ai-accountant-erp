"""
ERP AI Agent — Shared LLM Prompt Building
==========================================
Single source of truth for the prompts sent to ANY runtime AI provider
(Qwen primary, Gemini fallback).

Both provider clients build identical system instructions and user
content so that switching providers never changes the agent's behaviour,
context budget, or governance rules. The Constitution is truncated to a
fixed token budget and only RELEVANT ERP context (never the whole
database) is included — see context_manager.build_context().

"""Idempotency for financial mutations (migration 075).

An explicit, persistent, organization-scoped request key replaces the previous
amount-based duplicate guard, which covered ONE tool slug, ONE execution
session, nothing across restarts — and treated two legitimately identical
transactions as one, i.e. it could suppress a real financial record.

Semantics:
  * the first attempt CLAIMS the key and performs the mutation;
  * an identical retry (same key, same request hash) REPLAYS the stored result
    instead of writing again;
  * the same key with a DIFFERENT payload is refused (that is not a retry);
  * a FAILED attempt may be retried; an abandoned IN_PROGRESS claim is
    reclaimable by the database after a stale window, so a crash cannot wedge
    a key forever.

# spelled the same, and exactly where they are not, a predicate built on one
# vocabulary silently answers the wrong question for the other:
#
#   intent  record_expense          -> tool create_expense
#   intent  record_sale             -> tool create_invoice
#   intent  record_credit_sale      -> tool create_invoice
#   (the mapping lives in app/tool_selector.py: _INTENT_TOOLS)
#

# can never appear as a tool result name.

# TOOL SLUGS that write the books: the predicate vocabulary for
# "did this plan perform a financial mutation?" and "did the primary operation
# run and succeed?" (app/agent.py).
#
# Derived from the claim set above, with the two vocabulary errors corrected:
#   * the intent-only names are removed (no tool result can ever match them —
#     `record_expense` in the claim set made every RECORDED expense look like a
#     missing primary mutation, which PHASE 7/8 turned into FAILED);
#   * `create_expense` is ADDED (it writes the expense AND posts its journal —
#     it was absent, so an expense could never satisfy a financial predicate).
#
# This is NOT the claim set: `create_expense` deliberately stays out of
# FINANCIAL_MUTATION_TOOLS, because a derived claim key is
# ``session:<id>:<slug>`` — putting it in that set would make a SECOND,
# genuinely different expense in the same run collide on the key and be refused
# as "key reused with different parameters".  Widening exactly-once protection
# to expenses therefore needs its own change (key discrimination), tracked
# separately as it can suppress real records if done naively.

"""
ERP AI Agent — Requirement Reasoning & Dependency Resolution
=============================================================
Generic 360° requirement analysis for the agent's cognitive pipeline:

    REQUEST UNDERSTANDING
    → 360° IMPACT ANALYSIS
    → REQUIREMENT GAP ANALYSIS
    → TARGETED ERP CONTEXT ACQUISITION
    → DEPENDENCY GRAPH
    → RESOLUTION OF EACH DEPENDENCY
    → CONSOLIDATED CLARIFICATION (one questionnaire, not one drip-fed question)
    → RE-EVALUATION → PLAN → CONFIRMATION → EXECUTION

Design principles enforced here (ERP Agent Constitution-compatible):

* An empty database result is INFORMATION ("the record does not exist"),
  never a database failure.  Result states are classified explicitly —
  NOT_QUERIED / EMPTY_RESULT / FOUND / MULTIPLE_MATCHES / QUERY_FAILURE …
* 360° analysis is mandatory; 360° questioning is optional.  Only
  MISSING_AND_REQUIRED user decisions, genuine ambiguity, and
  configuration gaps become questions — everything deterministically
  resolvable is resolved silently.
* No arbitrary fallbacks: an ambiguous party match is surfaced, never
  silently resolved to "first hit".
* All question texts are consolidated into ONE questionnaire per round so
  the user answers every independent gap at once (pending-operation state
  is preserved by the existing clarification-history mechanism).

"""Tool argument contracts — Python is the authority.

Why this exists
---------------
The accounting-reasoning model authors ``proposal.tools[].arguments`` itself,
and nothing checked those names against the Python callable that would receive
them.  A plan could therefore be shown to the user, approved, executed — and
die at CALL-BINDING time:

    TypeError: create_invoice() got an unexpected keyword argument 'line_items'

The model may invent ``line_items`` / ``customer_name`` / ``tax_category``
because the reasoning prompt offers tool *slugs only* — no parameter contract is
ever shown.  Python must therefore reject the un-bindable call BEFORE the user is
asked to approve it, and say precisely which name is wrong.

Source of truth
---------------
The contract is DERIVED FROM THE SERVICE SIGNATURE (``inspect``) at import time:
never hand-maintained, never stale.

``ai.tool_parameters`` is deliberately NOT the source of truth — it is provably
out of date:

* it omits ``payment_terms_days``, ``discount_total``, ``terms`` and
  ``created_by`` although ``invoice_service.create_invoice`` accepts them;
* it marks ``subtotal`` as required for create_invoice although the service
  defaults it and recomputes the header from the validated lines — five
  SUCCESSFUL production invoices were recorded without it;
* three SUCCESSFUL production ``create_expense`` calls carry ``payee_name`` /
  ``payment_mode``, which that table does not list (the service accepts them).

A rule built on that table would have rejected working calls.  A rule built on
the signature is exactly the binding Python performs, so it can only ever reject
what would have raised.

Fail-open on *validation*, fail-closed on *execution*: a tool with no declared
contract is not validated here (it keeps today's behaviour), and a contract
that cannot be derived is simply absent.

    """Derive the argument contract of *fn* from its signature.

    ``accepted``      — every keyword the callable binds (excluding the
                        router-injected ``organization_id``).
    ``required``      — the subset that has NO default, i.e. a call omitting it
                        cannot bind.
    ``accepts_extra`` — the callable has ``**kwargs``, so unknown names are
                        silently tolerated and must NOT be rejected.

    ``extra_arguments`` — arguments the HANDLER consumes but *fn*'s signature
    does not describe.  The tool handler is what receives the model's arguments
    (``handler(organization_id, **arguments)``), and a handler may consume more
    than it forwards to the service:

        # app/tools/__init__.py
        async def _create_purchase_bill(organization_id, **kw):
            account_hint = _safe_account_hint(kw.pop("account_id", None))
            data = await purchase_service.create_purchase_bill(org, **kw)
            ... account_hint_id=account_hint ...   # journal debit account

    ``account_id`` there is a real, engine-validated JOURNAL HINT — and the
    deterministic purchase/expense fast paths set it themselves
    (app/agent.py: ``params["account_id"] = str(account_hint)``).  Describing
    only the service signature therefore rejected a call that binds perfectly
    well: production 2026-09-22, "I purchased two Tables for 49000 today" was
    blocked at PLAN_MATERIALIZATION with "'account_id' is not a parameter of
    this tool", the run parked in AWAITING_CLARIFICATION, and every later
    request was refused with "Your last request is still waiting for your
    answer".

    These names are added to ``accepted`` — never to ``required`` (the handler
    treats them as optional; absent means "no hint").  Declaring them is
    explicit and per-tool: this is NOT a blanket ``**kwargs`` allowance, and a
    name that no handler consumes is still rejected.

    ``[]`` also means "cannot judge": an absent contract (a tool that declares
    none) is never a rejection — this layer must not invent strictness.

    ``reference_inputs`` maps a canonical parameter to the DECLARED alias keys a
    plan may use instead (``{"customer_id": ("customer_name", …)}``).  Those
    aliases are read-only INPUTS to resolution: plan materialization turns them
    into the canonical id before the tool ever runs
    (see app/plan_materialization.py).  An alias therefore satisfies BOTH the
    unknown-key check and the required check for its parameter.

    Without this, the gate forbids the only shape a model can express when the
    referenced record does not exist yet — it has no id to pass, and inventing
    one is forbidden — so the plan could never be built (production
    2026-09-22, session 0076d9a0: three proposals rejected, reasoning exhausted,
    the request degraded to a preparatory plan and failed).

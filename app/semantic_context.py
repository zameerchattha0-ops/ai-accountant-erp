"""
AI-Native ERP — Semantic Context Package
========================================================

Builds the *relevant* context the semantic understanding layer is allowed to
see. Nothing here is optional decoration: every block exists because the LLM
cannot interpret the request correctly without it.

    USER REQUEST
    + CURRENT DATE CONTEXT
    + ORGANIZATION CONTEXT        (identity, currency, fiscal year, period)
    + RELEVANT ERP ENTITIES       (candidates matched against the user's words)
    + AVAILABLE ERP CAPABILITIES  (what this ERP can actually do)
    + CURRENT SESSION STATE       (original request, established facts)
    + PREVIOUS USER ANSWERS       (clarification continuity)
    + DOMAIN RULEBOOK             (how the deterministic agent reasons)

Bounding rules (non-negotiable)
-------------------------------
* ORGANIZATION-SCOPED: every query is issued with the authenticated
  ``organization_id``. The semantic layer can never see another tenant's data.
* RELEVANT, NOT EXHAUSTIVE: candidates are found by searching with terms
  taken from the USER'S OWN WORDS — never a table dump. Hard caps per kind.
* TRACEABLE: every candidate carries its database id, so grounding can name
  the exact record the LLM was shown. The LLM is told to reference those
  candidates; it may never invent an id.
* BEST-EFFORT: a failing source degrades to empty rather than failing the
  request (same isolation discipline as ``context_manager``).

The rulebook is the agent's reasoning brain expressed as instructions: the
grounding contract, the number/date resolution rules, the nature taxonomy,
money direction, the four information states, and the clarification law.
That is how the LLM is made to think the way the deterministic agent thinks
instead of guessing at ERP vocabulary.

# The domain rulebook — how the deterministic agent thinks
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# This is NOT a field list. It is the reasoning contract: the same laws the
# deterministic engine enforces, written so the LLM reasons WITH them instead
# of searching for keywords. Sending it is what makes the LLM's judgement the
# agent's judgement — the "brain", not just the parser.

_RULEBOOK_CORE = """
DOMAIN RULEBOOK - how this ERP's accounting agent reasons. Think with these
rules; they are the same laws the deterministic engine enforces afterwards.

A. UNDERSTAND MEANING, NOT WORDS
   Business meaning decides everything. "we supplied HJK with 2 chairs worth
   23k, settlement deferred" and "HJK bought two chairs from us for 23,000
   and will pay later" are THE SAME business event. Never require the user to
   use a word this system knows; infer the act from its economic meaning.

B. GROUND EVERY COPIED VALUE (verbatim only)
   A party name or item must be copied EXACTLY as written in the request
   (same words, same spelling). If you cannot copy it verbatim, do not output
   it. NEVER invent, translate, shorten or "tidy" a name.

C. NUMBERS
   Written numbers become digits: two -> 2, a pair of -> 2, a dozen -> 12,
   23k -> 23000, 2.5 lac -> 250000, twenty-three thousand -> 23000.
   amount = the money value (no currency symbol). quantity = units.

D. DATES
   Resolve relative expressions with the provided current date:
   yesterday -> current date minus 1 day; "two days ago" -> minus 2;
   "last Friday" -> the most recent Friday before today; "end of last month"
   -> the last day of the previous month. Explicit dates -> YYYY-MM-DD
   (treat DD/MM/YYYY as day-first). If the request states no date and none can
   be derived, the date is MISSING - never default it silently.

E. MONEY DIRECTION DECIDES THE PARTY ROLE
   Money coming IN (sale, invoice, credit note, receipt) means the party is a
   CUSTOMER. Money going OUT (purchase, bill, expense, payment, return) means
   the party is a SUPPLIER. The role is derived from the direction of the act,
   not from a keyword.

F. TRANSACTION NATURE (classify only when the item makes it unambiguous)
   GOODS           stock items the business deals in
   SERVICE         work or expertise delivered
   ASSET_DISPOSAL  selling a fixed asset the business owns
   OTHER_INCOME    income outside the trading activity
   If several treatments are materially possible, the nature is AMBIGUOUS -
   never choose silently.

G. FOUR INFORMATION STATES - classify EVERY material fact
   EXPLICIT         the user stated it. Preserve exactly.
   SAFELY_INFERRED  derived by a rule above (e.g. "yesterday" -> a date).
                    Always include the evidence you inferred it from.
   AMBIGUOUS        the request contains information, but several materially
                    different interpretations remain (e.g. the user says "ABC"
                    and the organization has ABC Pvt Ltd and ABC Traders).
                    Never pick one silently.
   MISSING          not stated and not safely derivable, but REQUIRED for this
                    operation. Never guess it.

H. AMBIGUOUS IS NOT MISSING
   AMBIGUOUS = something was said, but it does not resolve to one record.
   MISSING   = nothing was said. They need different questions: ambiguity
   offers the competing options; missing asks openly for the value.

I. NEVER ASK WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN
   If a fact is EXPLICIT or SAFELY_INFERRED or already in ALREADY ESTABLISHED
   FACTS / PREVIOUS USER ANSWERS, it must NOT appear in missing or in any
   question. Asking again for information the user already gave is the failure
   this architecture exists to prevent.

J. QUESTIONS ARE GENERATED, NOT TEMPLATED
   Decide what is ACTUALLY required before this particular operation can be
   recorded safely, subtract everything known, and ask ONLY the remainder.
   A fully-stated request asks NOTHING. Ask at most 3 questions, each one
   specific to this request's real gap, with the concrete values involved.

K. GROUND ENTITIES, NEVER INVENT IDS
   You may name a party/item from the user's words or from the RELEVANT
   EXISTING RECORDS section. You must NEVER output a database id - Python
   resolves real records. If a named party is not in the records and the text
   is ambiguous, mark it AMBIGUOUS with the candidate names you were shown.

L. DO NOT INVENT
   AI-first never means manufacturing values. Anything not stated and not
   derivable by a rule above is MISSING/AMBIGUOUS - never a plausible guess.

M. YOU INTERPRET ONLY
   You never decide what is authorised, never compute debits/credits, never
   balance a journal and never execute anything. The backend validates,
   the accounting engine composes the entries and the tools execute.

"""
Dedicated revenue ledgers — per revenue stream.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
A trusted sale tool must decide WHICH revenue account to credit.  It used to
fall back to "the first REVENUE account in the chart", which meant a sale of a
MOBILE PHONE was credited to *Software Development Revenue* purely because that
account sorted first in a SOFTWARE_HOUSE organisation's chart:

    Dr  1020  Cash                          25,000.00
    Cr  4010  Software Development Revenue  25,000.00   <-- wrong stream

That is a revenue-mix misstatement, and it happened silently.  The correct
behaviour, per the enhancement brief's "Ask -> Understand -> Classify ->
Validate -> Execute" principle, is:

  1. derive the STREAM from what was actually sold (the item description);
  2. use a dedicated ledger for that stream when one exists;
  3. otherwise fall back only to an UNAMBIGUOUS general revenue account;
  4. otherwise REFUSE and ask — never pick one of several at random.

Step 4 is the important one: an unresolved revenue account is a question for
the user, not a coin toss.  Nothing in this module invents or renames accounts.

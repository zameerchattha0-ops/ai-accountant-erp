"""
AI-first perception stage â€” grounded LLM fact extraction.

ARCHITECTURE CHANGE (S1 -> S2)
------------------------------
S1 was a *gap-filler*: keyword regex ran first, and the LLM was consulted only
when the regex came up empty. That made the pipeline keyword-oriented â€” any
phrasing outside the hard-coded templates produced a questionnaire asking for
facts the user had already given (e.g. "record a sale of two chairs on credit
for 23000 to hjk pvt limited" asked "Who is the customer?").

S2 inverts it, AI-first:
  1. The user's request goes to the LLM FIRST, together with a distilled
     rulebook of the deterministic agent (grounding, written numbers, date
     resolution, the nature taxonomy, party direction).
  2. The extracted facts are GROUNDED in Python: every copied value must
     occur verbatim in the user's own text; numbers must be traceable to a
     digit or written-number token; dates must be an ISO/slash date in the
     text or a resolvable relative word; payment methods must map to a
     keyword that is actually present.
  3. The grounded facts prefill the deterministic planner, so the
     questionnaire contains ONLY genuinely missing fields and everything the
     user stated flows to the next stages.
  4. The regex extractor remains as the FALLBACK: provider down, timeout,
     malformed JSON -> {} -> exactly the old keyword behaviour. The LLM can
     never make a request fail.

This stage never mutates anything and never talks to tools; it is perception
only. The planner + trusted tools keep full authority over what is executed.

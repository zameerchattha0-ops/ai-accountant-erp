"""
AI-Native ERP — Semantic Intent Contract
=========================================================

The formal representation of *business meaning* produced by the LLM semantic
understanding layer (``app/semantic_layer.py``) and consumed by the
deterministic planner.

This module is PURE: no I/O, no LLM, no database. It defines the vocabulary
and the information-state algebra so that every other stage shares one
definition of "what is known".

Architecture: ``docs/SEMANTIC_ARCHITECTURE.md``.

Why a contract instead of a bag of planner fields
-------------------------------------------------
S1 handed the planner loose planner fields (``customer_name``, ``amount``…).
That is a parser, not understanding: it cannot express *which* facts are
merely inferred, *which* are ambiguous, or *what* is genuinely missing — so
the questionnaire had to be reconstructed from the schema and asked for
things the user had already said.

The contract keeps the normalized ERP fields (the planner still needs them)
but wraps every fact in its INFORMATION STATE:

    EXPLICIT         the user stated it            (preserve exactly)
    SAFELY_INFERRED  derived by a documented rule  (carries evidence)
    AMBIGUOUS        several materially different meanings remain
    MISSING          not stated and not derivable

Only a fact that is EXPLICIT or SAFELY_INFERRED may become a prefill value.
AMBIGUOUS and MISSING become *targeted questions*, and they are different
questions: AMBIGUOUS offers the competing candidates as options, MISSING
asks openly for the one thing that is absent.

-- =====================================================================
-- Migration 067: business_aware_coa
-- =====================================================================
-- WHY THIS EXISTS
-- ---------------
-- 1. GRANULARITY. Every organization was seeded from one of seven
--    service-industry templates whose asset side ended at a single
--    "Computer Equipment" account.  There was no way to represent
--    Furniture & Fixtures, Office Equipment, Vehicles, Machinery,
--    Buildings or Leasehold Improvements, so fixed-asset reporting had
--    nothing to report on.
-- 2. HIERARCHY. `accounts.parent_account_id` has always existed but was
--    never populated: every seeded account was flat (verified live:
--    0 of 333 accounts had a parent).  Fixed-asset classes therefore had
--    no structure to group by.
-- 3. BUSINESS AWARENESS. Only 7 of the 16 `business_type_code` values
--    had a template.  Onboarding a trading, manufacturing, e-commerce,
--    construction, healthcare or education business silently fell back
--    to GENERAL_SERVICE (verified live: an E_COMMERCE and a
--    MANUFACTURING organization both received the identical service
--    chart).
-- 4. A LATENT GAP. `create_organization` never created the
--    organization's `chart_of_accounts` row, so every seeded account had
--    `chart_of_accounts_id = NULL`.  The banking screen resolves that row
--    before it will create a bank GL account and therefore refused to
--    work for every organization created through onboarding.
--
-- HOW IT WORKS
-- ------------
-- `account_catalog` is the SINGLE source of truth for the chart.  A row
-- is either unconditional, restricted to specific business types, or
-- part of an optional group.  `account_catalog_groups` describes those
-- optional bundles (fixed-asset classes, inventory, cost of sales,
-- borrowings, ...) and `account_catalog_group_business_types` records
-- which business types may be offered a bundle and whether it is
-- recommended by default.
--
-- `rebuild_account_template_items()` materialises the catalog into the
-- pre-existing `account_template_items` reference table (per template),
-- so the runtime seeding path is unchanged: it still reads
-- `account_template_items`.  Seeding now also applies
-- `suggested_parent_code` and links `chart_of_accounts`.
--
-- The AI onboarding assistant reads exactly this catalog
-- (`account_template_catalog`) so it can only ever propose real,
-- backend-compatible accounts — it can never invent one.
--
-- EXISTING ORGANIZATIONS ARE NOT TOUCHED.  Accounts already created keep
-- their ids, codes, names and (null) parents: journal lines reference
-- accounts by id and history must stay intact.  Only the reference data
-- used for FUTURE organization creation changes, plus the optional,
-- explicit `apply_organization_onboarding` RPC an owner may call.

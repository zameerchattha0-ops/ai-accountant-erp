"""
AI Worker - DB-backed background job processor
===============================================================
A SUPERVISED process (not a FastAPI background task) that claims queued
AI runs from ``ai.worker_jobs`` (FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED via
``ai.claim_worker_job``) and executes them through the SAME trusted
``agent.execute()`` pipeline as the synchronous endpoint.

Usage:
    venv\\Scripts\\python scripts\\ai_worker.py            # poll forever
    venv\\Scripts\\python scripts\\ai_worker.py --once     # drain one job

Jobs are enqueued by POST /api/ai/jobs; clients poll GET /api/ai/jobs/{id}
or /api/ai/progress?conversation_id=... (the run records its steps exactly
like a synchronous run, because it IS the same pipeline).

Authorisation model: enqueueing requires a valid JWT (enforced by the
API), so the job's user identity is trustworthy.  The AUTHORIZATION is NOT
inherited from enqueue time: the worker reconstructs a fresh AuthContext
(membership + status + role) before every execution, because a job can sit
in the queue while the user is suspended, removed or downgraded.  A job
whose organization no longer matches the user's active membership is
refused rather than executed in the wrong tenant.
